## 🧠 Algorithm Explanation

### Traffic Signal Timing Logic

#### **Step 1: Congestion Classification**
```
Low Congestion:     < 10 vehicles
Medium Congestion:  10-30 vehicles
High Congestion:    > 30 vehicles
```

#### **Step 2: Green Time Calculation**
The system uses **proportional allocation** to distribute green time fairly:

```
Green Time = (Vehicles_in_Lane / Total_Vehicles) × Total_Cycle_Time

Where:
- Total_Cycle_Time = 80 seconds (4 lanes × 20s average)
- Minimum Green: 10 seconds
- Maximum Green: 60 seconds
```

**Example**:
```
Scenario:
- North: 40 vehicles
- South: 20 vehicles
- East: 10 vehicles
- West: 30 vehicles
- Total: 100 vehicles

Calculated Green Times:
- North: (40/100) × 80 = 32 seconds ✓ (within 10-60s range)
- South: (20/100) × 80 = 16 seconds ✓
- East: (10/100) × 80 = 8 seconds → Clipped to 10s (minimum)
- West: (30/100) × 80 = 24 seconds ✓
```

#### **Step 3: Fair Lane Rotation**
Lanes cycle in fixed order to prevent starvation:
```
North → East → South → West → North → ...
```

Even if one lane has low traffic, it still gets a minimum 10-second green light.

#### **Step 4: Signal Transitions**
- **Red (🔴)**: Lane waiting for green light
- **Green (🟢)**: Lane currently receiving traffic
- **Yellow (🟡)**: Transition phase (for future enhancement)

## 📊 Example Simulation Walkthrough

### Initial State
```
North:  30 vehicles  | State: GREEN  | Green Time: 30s
South:  15 vehicles  | State: RED    | Green Time: 15s
East:   10 vehicles  | State: RED    | Green Time: 10s
West:   45 vehicles  | State: RED    | Green Time: 35s
```

### After 30 Seconds
North's green time expires, rotates to East:
```
North:  30 vehicles  | State: RED    | Green Time: 30s
South:  15 vehicles  | State: RED    | Green Time: 15s
East:   10 vehicles  | State: GREEN  | Green Time: 10s
West:   45 vehicles  | State: RED    | Green Time: 35s
```

### Dynamic Adjustment
If vehicles increase in West lane during simulation:
```
West:   75 vehicles  | Updated Green Time: 45s → 60s (clamped to max)
```

## 🔧 Configuration & Customization

### Adjust Signal Parameters
Edit `logic.py` to modify default values:

```python
self.min_green_time = 10      # Change minimum green duration
self.max_green_time = 60      # Change maximum green duration
self.base_green_time = 20     # Change base cycle time
```

### Add More Lanes
To extend from 4-way to 6-way junction:

1. Update `lanes` dictionary in `__init__()`:
```python
self.lanes = {
    'North': {...},
    'South': {...},
    'East': {...},
    'West': {...},
    'NorthEast': {...},  # New lane
    'SouthWest': {...}   # New lane
}
```

2. Update lane rotation in `get_next_lane()`:
```python
lane_order = ['North', 'East', 'South', 'West', 'NorthEast', 'SouthWest']
```

3. Update UI grid in `app.py` to display additional lanes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: App doesn't start
```bash
# Ensure all dependencies are installed
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.8+
```

### Issue: Sliders not updating
- Refresh the browser (F5)
- Clear browser cache
- Restart Streamlit: `streamlit run app.py`

### Issue: Simulation runs too fast
- Adjust `time.sleep(3)` in `app.py` line for slower cycling
- Default is 3 seconds per cycle

### Issue: Deployment error on Streamlit Cloud
- Ensure `requirements.txt` is in root directory
- Verify `app.py` is the main entry point
- Check Python version compatibility
